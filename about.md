Hello! I am Vasilis Naskos, a passionate software engineer with a special love to explore the unknown. Currently, I am working as a software engineer at CERN developing network tools to assist scientists to solve mysteries of the universe. At the same time, I am doing my first steps in starting a travel-tech startup ([Check this out :grin:](https://levart.app)).
